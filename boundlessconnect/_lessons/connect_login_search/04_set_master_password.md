If you haven’t done it before, QGIS will ask you to set a *Master Password*. The
*Master Password* is used to protect all your credentials inside QGIS, for
example, username and passwords for connecting to spatial databases.

Choose your master password wisely and make sure you memorize it, as the master
password is not retrievable.

1. Type in the password twice and click **OK**.

If you already have set a master password, you may be asked to enter it
to unlock QGIS’s authentication database and save your Boundless Connect
credentials in it.In that case, type your master password and click **OK**

**Note:** If neither of the dialogs shows up, then you can safely skip this step, as it
seems that you have already provided your master password.

When you are done, click **Next Step**.
