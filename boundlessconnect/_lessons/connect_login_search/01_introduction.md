The **Boundless Connect** plugin allows you to browse, visualize and download
Boundless Connect Portal content from within QGIS. Before you use it, you
should login using your Boundless Connect credentials to have full access
to the content.

This lesson will walk you trough the login process and Master Password setting.
After a successfull  login, the lesson will teach how to search for specific
content using the search tabs and filters.
