As seen before, searching in the **Knowledge** tab returns resources from
different categories. You can narrow down the results using the **Search for**
drop-down list to filter the categories you want to search.

1. Click the widget down arrow to expand the categories.

Now, your search should only return resources from the documentation
category.

**Note:** You can search several categories, by enabling more than one category.

When you are done, click **Next Step**.
