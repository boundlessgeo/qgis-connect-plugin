Installation
============

The |connect_plugin| is a core plugin in |BLQGIS|'s QGIS and does not need to be
installed. If you can't see either the |connect_plugin|'s panel or its menu
entries, make sure it's activated. Go to :menuselection:`Plugins --> Manage and
Install Plugins`, and in the :guilabel:`Installed` tab make sure the plugin's
checkbox is enabled.
