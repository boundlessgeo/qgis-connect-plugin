Installation
============

If you are using |BLQGIS|, the |connect_plugin| should be installed in its QGIS by default.

If instead you are using QGIS from one of the community's installers, you can install the |connect_plugin| from the *Boundless QGIS Plugin Repository*. For instructions on how to setup up Boundless repository, please refer to the following `link <http://qgis.boundlessgeo.com/#using-the-repository-in-qgis>`_.
