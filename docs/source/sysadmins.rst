For system administrators

.. _configure-repository-location:

Configure the repository location
---------------------------------

The |connect_plugin| can work with the standard remote *Boundless QGIS Plugin
Repository*, use an internal repository (e.g. in Docker container) or install
plugins from a local folder (useful for customers with special requirements,
when connection to external resources is not possible).

On its first run, the |connect_plugin| will look for ``$HOME/.qgis2/repoUrl.txt``
file. If the file exists, the plugin will read the repository URL/path from it
and use this as a location for the plugins repository. Otherwise, if the file
is not found, the standard Boundless QGIS Plugins Repository URL will be used.
After this, the file will be deleted.

.. warning::

   Creating a new file after the first launch of |connect_plugin| will have no
   effect whatsoever. The plugin will ignore the new file and will continue to
   use the already saved repository location.

The ``$HOME/.qgis2/repoUrl.txt`` file is an INI-like text file with single
``general`` section and only one key-value pair, for example:

::

  [general]
  repoUrl=https://qgis.boundlessgeo.com/plugins/plugins.xml

The value of the ``repoUrl`` key with repository location can be:

* A **Repository URL**. The plugin will add this URL to the list of available
  plugins repositories and QGIS *Plugin Manager* can be used to access it.
  This is the default.
* An **absolute path to the plugins directory**. In this case, the directory
  should contain plugins packages as well as repository description file
  ``plugins.xml``. With this option, nothing is added to the QGIS settings,
  as QGIS *Plugin Manager* can not handle directories yet.

.. TODO:: Make an example of an XML

.. _add-additional-plugins:

Installing additional plugins by default
----------------------------------------

If the system administrator wants to automatically install a bundle of
additional plugins during the post-installation step, he can create a directory
``$HOME/.qgis2/first-run-plugins`` under the user folder and put all the
desired plugins ZIP packages in it.

The *First Run wizard* tool from |connect_plugin| will check if the directory
exists and will install all the ZIP packages from it. Notice that the packages
will be removed after the installation.

Setting up repository in Docker container
-----------------------------------------

It is possible to create Docker-based plugin repository using our orchestrated
setup from `qgis-plugin-repos <https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-plugin-repos>`_
repository.

To use our scripts you will need docker >= 1.10 and docker-compose >= 1.6.

First you need to clone repository

::

  git clone --recursive git@github.com:boundlessgeo/qgis-plugin-repos.git
  cd qgis-plugin-repos/docker-plugins-xml

Edit `docker-compose.env` file specifying your own user name and passford for
SSH service and plugin repository domain. Then source this file using command

::

  source docker-compose.env

and finally build Docker images

::

  docker-compose build

To start containers use following command

::

  docker-compose up  -d

More details available in `README <https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-plugin-repos/blob/master/docker-plugins-xml/README.md>`_
file inside GitHub repository.

*NOTE*: our scripts are just sample and should not be used in production. Before
deploying this repository in production it is necessary to perform additional
configuration, namely improve security.

Uploading plugins to repository
...............................

To add new plugin to the repository follow these steps:

# copy plugin's package to server

  ::

    scp plugin.zip repository.domain:/opt/repo-updater/uploads/

# run remote updater script on uploaded archive

  ::

    ssh repository.domain "/opt/repo-updater/plugins-xml/plugins-xml.sh update plugin.zip"

Run `plugins-xml.sh --help` to get infomation about script usage and subcommands.

More details in `README <https://github.com/boundlessgeo/qgis-plugins-xml/blob/master/README.md>`_
file inside GitHub repository.
