Boundless Connect QGIS Plugin Documentation
===========================================

The main goal of |connect_plugin| is to help users setting up Boundless Plugin
Repository and make it easier for them install plugins and their components.
The current version provides:

* Connect Wizard for post-installation QGIS setup
* Support for local directory-based plugins repository
* Automated way of installing additional non-Boundless plugins
* Ability to install QGIS plugins from local ZIP packages

|connect_plugin| is the only "core" plugin shipped with |BLQGIS|, and will act
as a single entry point to Boundless technology and content for QGIS
(e.g. plugins, tutorials, profiles, styles, etc.).
