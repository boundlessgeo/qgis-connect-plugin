Boundless Connect Plugin Documentation
======================================

The main goal of |connect_plugin| is to provide |BLQGIS| integration with `Boundless Connect <https://connect.boundlessgeo.com/>`_ portal, making it easier to install boundless plugins and also
access additional resources like training materials, documentation, lessons, styles, etc. The current version provides:

* Boundless Connect Login
* Search and install Boundless plugins for QGIS
* Search for additional resources in Boundless Connect portal and ability
  to download/view them
* Support for local directory-based plugins repository
* Automated way of installing additional non-Boundless plugins
* Ability to install QGIS plugins from local ZIP packages

|connect_plugin| is the only "core" plugin shipped with |BLQGIS|, and will act as a single entry point to Boundless technology and content for QGIS
(e.g. plugins, tutorials, profiles, styles, etc.).
