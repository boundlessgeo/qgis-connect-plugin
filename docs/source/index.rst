Boundless Connect Plugin Documentation
======================================

The main goal of |connect_plugin| is to help users setting up Boundless Plugin
Repository within QGIS and make it easier for them to install plugins and their components.
The current version provides:

* Boundless Connect Login
* Support for local directory-based plugins repository
* Automated way of installing additional non-Boundless plugins
* Ability to install QGIS plugins from local ZIP packages
* Notifications about updates for Boundless plugins and automated way to install
  them

|connect_plugin| is the only "core" plugin shipped with |BLQGIS|, and will act
as a single entry point to Boundless technology and content for QGIS
(e.g. plugins, tutorials, profiles, styles, etc.).
