Boundless Connect QGIS Plugin Documentation
===========================================

The main goal of *Boundless Connect QGIS Plugin* is to help users setting up Boundless Plugin Repository and make it easier for them install plugins and their components. Tehe current version provides:

* First Run wizard for post-installation QGIS setup;
* Support for local directory-based plugins repository;
* Automated way of installing additional non-Boundless plugins;
* Ability to install QGIS plugins from local ZIP packages.

*Boundless Connect QGIS Plugin* is the only "core" plugin shipped with |BLQGIS|, and will acts as "gateway" from QGIS to all Boundless content (e.g. plugins, tutorials, profiles, styles, etc.).
